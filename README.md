# JavaScript Techdegree Project #: Public API requests

A live version of this project can be found [here](https://rliess.github.io/js-techdegree-project5/).

Installation:

Since the app uses the Fetch API it can't run locally. The following files and directories must be copied on a web server:

* `index.html`
* `css/` folder
* `js/` folder

The goal of this project was to build an app for a fictional company called “Awesome Startup”, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They need a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other.

The [Random User Generator API](https://randomuser.me/) is used to grab information for 12 random “employees” and use that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.
